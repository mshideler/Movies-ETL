# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this repository is to house code that automates the import of new movie and ratings data, transforming that new data and then loading it into existing tables.

Although there are 2 CSV files in the Resources folder, they should be moved into the same folder as the IPYNB files so the code for the file directory doesn't cause errors.
